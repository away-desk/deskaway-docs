# AGENT.md — deskaway-docs

Documentation that belongs to no single component: architecture decisions
spanning repos, product specs, and the diagrams that explain how the pieces
fit. It is the landing page for the whole system.

The test for whether something belongs here: if it would have to be written
identically in two repos, it goes here. If it only describes one repo, it
stays with that repo's code.

## Folder structure

```
README.md                 # index of every component repo
AGENT.md                  # this file
CLAUDE.md                 # pointer to this file
```

That is the entire repo today. The layout below is proposed, not built —
create a directory when there is something real to put in it, not before:

```
adr/                      # cross-repo architecture decision records
specs/                    # product and feature specs
diagrams/                 # source files, not just exported images
```

Component-local docs live with their code and stay there — `deskaway-relay`
has its own `docs/adr/` for decisions that only affect the relay, and the
same goes for the agent and desktop repos.

## Conventions

- One decision per ADR, numbered and dated, and never rewritten after it is
  accepted. A reversal is a new ADR that supersedes the old one, with a link
  in both directions.
- An ADR lands here only if it constrains more than one repo. Relay-only
  choices belong in `deskaway-relay/docs/adr/`.
- Commit diagram sources alongside any exported image. An image nobody can
  edit is a dead end.
- The component table in `README.md` is the system's index. A new repo in the
  org is not done until it appears there.
- Link to code, don't restate it. Anything copied out of a repo will drift;
  describe the shape and point at the source.

## Rule: keep README.md current

The README is the one file a newcomer is guaranteed to read. Revisit it
whenever this repo's answer to any of the four questions below changes — not
on a schedule.

Every DeskAway README answers four things, in this order:

1. **What this one repo is**, in two lines, and where it sits in the whole
   system.
2. **Its current status**, stated honestly. Right now that is *early
   development, nothing works yet.*
3. **How to run it locally**, aiming for under ten minutes.
4. **A link back** to the org or to `deskaway-docs`, so someone landing here
   can find the rest.

How to apply it:

- Keep those four as the first four sections, in that order. Anything else
  goes after them.
- Status rots fastest. The moment the first thing in this repo actually
  runs, that line changes in the same PR. "Nothing works yet" is honest
  only until it isn't.
- If a setup step breaks, or creeps past ten minutes, fix the README in the
  PR that caused it. A stale run section is worse than no run section.
- Never write intent as if it were fact. Anything not yet true is either
  labelled as planned or left out entirely.
- Two lines means two lines. If section 1 needs a third paragraph, that
  content belongs in `deskaway-docs`.

## Rule: keep CHANGELOG.md current

Add a line the moment you do something notable — not at release time. The
changelog is cheap to maintain one entry at a time and miserable to
reconstruct from five months of git log.

- Format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
  versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
- Everything lands under `## [Unreleased]`, grouped by `### Added`,
  `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, or `Security`. Create a group
  when you first need it.
- "Notable" means a reader of this repo would want to know: a new capability,
  a behaviour change, a dependency that changes how you run it, a security
  fix. Not: formatting, a typo, an internal rename nobody outside the file
  can see.
- Write for someone who has not read the diff. "Added pairing code
  expiry" beats "updated code-generator.ts".
- On a release, rename `[Unreleased]` to the version with the date, and open
  a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` above it. Never delete history.
- Entries are past tense and one line. If yours needs a paragraph, it is
  probably two entries.

## Rule: keep the pull request template useful

`.github/pull_request_template.md` pre-fills every PR description. While this
project is one person reviewing their own work, it is the self-check that
catches what you were about to skip — so fill it in honestly rather than
deleting the prompts.

- Answer all five. "N/A" is a fine answer; a blank section is not.
- **Which unit of the plan this belongs to** is the one that pays off later.
  In five months this is how you find which PR did what, so name the unit,
  not the file you touched.
- **Anything deliberately left incomplete** is not an admission. An
  acknowledged gap is a decision; an unmentioned one is a bug you will
  rediscover.
- Change the template when a prompt stops earning its place, and keep it at
  five or six. A template long enough to skim past is worse than none.

## Rule: keep CONTRIBUTING.md short

It is currently five lines because there are no outside contributors. Resist
growing it for people who do not exist yet.

- Update it when the real answer changes: the formatter command, the branch
  rule, or the day the project starts accepting outside contributions.
- Anything longer than a few lines is either repo guidance — which belongs in
  this file — or cross-repo process, which belongs in `deskaway-docs`.

## Rule: keep SECURITY.md honest

One line in it will become false, and it is the important one.

- The supported-versions table says *nothing is supported, do not run this*.
  The day a version is tagged, that table changes in the same PR — an
  unsupported-looking project that is actually shipping teaches people to
  ignore the file.
- The reporting route depends on whether the repo is public. GitHub private
  vulnerability reporting is a public-repository feature and cannot be enabled
  on a private one, so while these repos are private the route is an issue in
  the affected repo. The day a repo goes public, work through the checklist in
  SECURITY.md before flipping that switch, then rewrite the section to point at
  the Security tab. Never advertise a reporting route that does not exist.
- The "what protects these repositories today" section must stay accurate and
  unflattering. It currently says there is no server-side net, because secret
  scanning, push protection and branch protection are all unavailable for
  private repos on this plan. If that changes — a plan upgrade, or a repo going
  public — update it. An overstated security posture is its own risk.
- Do not soften the warning about executing model-authored shell commands
  while the scope, approval and timeout controls are still unwritten. It is
  the most accurate sentence in the repo.

## Rule: ask before touching GitHub, and never push to main

This overrides anything else in this file. Abhay approves every action that
leaves this machine.

### Ask first

Stop and ask before running any of these, showing the exact command:

- `git push` — any branch, any remote, including the first push of a new
  branch
- opening, editing, merging or closing a pull request
- creating or deleting a remote branch, tag or release
- any `gh` command that writes: issues, comments, labels, reviews, workflow
  runs, repo or org settings
- anything at all involving `--force`, `--force-with-lease`, or a remote
  delete

Do not batch these up and ask once at the end. Ask at the point of doing it,
and wait for a clear yes.

### No approval needed

Local work is yours to get on with: `status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `add`,
`commit`, creating and switching local branches, `stash`, reading anything.
Commit freely — a local commit is not a GitHub action.

### Every feature goes through a branch and a PR

`main` is never pushed to directly. The loop for any change:

1. Branch off current `main`: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/` or
   `refactor/` plus a short kebab-case description — `feat/pairing-code-expiry`.
2. Commit locally, as many commits as the work needs.
3. **Ask**, then push the branch.
4. **Ask**, then open the PR against `main`, filling in every prompt of the
   pull request template.
5. Report back: the branch, the PR link, what is in it, and anything left
   incomplete.
6. **Stop there.** Do not merge, do not squash, do not delete the branch, do
   not mark anything ready or draft. Abhay says what happens next.

A rejected or unanswered request is a stop, not a prompt to find another
route to the same result.

## Rule: how docs are maintained, everywhere

Three rules govern documentation in every DeskAway repo, this one included.

**1. A decision is not locked until it is written.** An unwritten decision lives in a
chat window, and a chat window is gone. If a pull request settled something, the ADR
belongs in that pull request.

**2. The doc changes in the same pull request as the code.** Not in a follow-up. The
pull request template asks which doc changed or why none was needed; answering that
one line honestly catches almost everything.

**3. Docs are written for someone who was not there.** Not for you today — for a
stranger, or for you in March having forgotten all of it. Any sentence that only
makes sense because you remember the conversation needs rewriting. The test: could
someone who has never spoken to you act on this?

The per-file rules — `architecture.md`, `adr/`, `local-setup.md`, `runbook.md` — live
in each component repo's own `AGENT.md`, because the files live there. This repo holds
cross-repo ADRs only; the format is the same, and the rule against editing an
accepted one applies here too.

## Rule: check for keys before staging or committing

Run this before `git add`, and again before `git commit`. A secret that reaches a
commit is compromised even if the next commit removes it — it stays in the history,
in every clone, and in any fork. Rotating it is then the only real fix, so the
cheap moment to catch it is before it is staged.

### The check

Paste this at the repo root. It reports what *would* be committed, not what is on
disk:

```sh
# 1. What is actually staged?
git diff --cached --name-only

# 2. Would any credential-shaped file be committed?
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -Ei '\.(pem|key|pfx|p12|jks|keystore|snk|ppk|tfstate|tfvars)$|(^|/)\.env($|\.)|(^|/)(id_rsa|id_ed25519|credentials|secrets?\.(ya?ml|json))$'

# 3. Does any staged content look like a secret?
git diff --cached -U0 | grep -nEi '(api[_-]?key|secret|passwo?rd|token|bearer|private[_-]?key|access[_-]?key)[[:space:]]*[:=]|BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY|sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{16,}|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|gh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}|eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}'

# 4. Is anything credential-shaped already tracked from an earlier commit?
git ls-files | grep -Ei '\.(pem|key|pfx|p12|jks|keystore|snk|ppk|tfstate|tfvars)$|(^|/)\.env($|\.)'
```

**Checks 2, 3 and 4 must print nothing.** If any of them prints, stop and deal with
it before continuing — do not commit "just to save progress".

### Reading the results

- **A hit in check 2 or 4** — the file must not be tracked. Add the pattern to
  `.gitignore`, then `git rm --cached <file>` to untrack it while keeping your local
  copy.
- **A hit in check 3** — read it before assuming the worst. A variable *name* in a
  config schema, a documented placeholder, or `KEY_HERE` in an example is fine. An
  actual value is not. If you cannot tell, treat it as real.
- **A hit that is genuinely a false positive** — leave it and move on. Do not add a
  suppression; the next person needs to see the same hit and make the same
  judgement.

### If a secret is already committed

Assume it is public from the moment it existed in a commit.

1. **Rotate the credential first.** Before touching git history, before telling
   anyone. A rotated secret in history is a non-event; an unrotated one removed from
   history is still a live secret sitting in someone's clone and in the reflog.
2. Then remove it from the working tree and add the pattern to `.gitignore`.
3. Only then consider rewriting history, and only if it never left this machine.
   Once it is pushed, rewriting is not a fix — the rotation was the fix.
4. Note it in the pull request. A quietly rotated key is a thing nobody can audit.

### What each repo's `.gitignore` must already cover

Keeping these in `.gitignore` is what makes the check above quiet enough to be
worth running:

- **Every repo** — `.env` and `.env.*` with an exception for `.env.example`, plus
  `*.pem` and `*.key`.
- **`deskaway-desktop`** — `*.pfx` and `*.snk`. Code-signing material; treat it as
  more sensitive than a service credential, because it signs software that runs
  commands on people's machines.
- **`deskaway-android`** — `*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `keystore.properties`,
  `signing.properties`. Same reasoning.
- **`deskaway-infra`** — `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `*.tfplan`, and `.terraform/`.
  **State and plan files contain resolved secret values in plaintext**, which is why
  they are ignored rather than merely discouraged. Never paste a raw plan into an
  issue or a pull request comment either.

If you add a new kind of credential to a repo, add its pattern to `.gitignore` in
the same pull request that introduces it — not after the first near miss.

### A note on `.env.example`

It is tracked deliberately: it documents which variables exist. It holds **names and
obviously-fake values only**. The moment a real value is pasted in for convenience,
the file stops being a template and becomes a leak with an innocent-looking name.
